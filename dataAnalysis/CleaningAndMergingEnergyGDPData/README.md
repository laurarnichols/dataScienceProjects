# Energy GDP and Publishing Data

This was an assignment as a part of a class I took on Coursera called Introduction to Data Science in Python from the University of 
Michigan.

This assignment involved reading in 3 data sets, getting rid of missing/bad values in all of them, and merging certain portions of the 
data into a new data frame.
