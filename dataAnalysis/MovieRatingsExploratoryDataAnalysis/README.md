# Movie Ratings Exploratory Data Analysis

A lot of information can be gleaned from data before getting to machine-learning algorithms. This data set gives movie review information such as the review score out of 5, the movie name, and genre as well as information about the reviewer like their gender, occupation, and zip code. In this notebook, I explore the data through plots and split the data up to gain new insights on features like movies that have the largest difference between male and female ratings or how the number of ratings for a given movie is related to the average rating for that movie.
